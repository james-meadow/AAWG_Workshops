### Files: 

* `AAWG.ipynb` = Beginner level intro to python for data science. 

* `AAWG_NLP.ipynb` = Advanced intro to Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling in python. 

### Workshop Instructions: 

* Clone or download this repo: 
  * Use the green "Clone or download" button on the right. 
  * If you already know how to use Git, you can clone it. 
  Otherwise, download it to your computer and unzip it. 
  * Get into the folder so you can see the two `.ipynb` files. 

* Start a Colab Jupyter session: 
  * go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and log in 
    * Either use your own personal gmail account (ideal) or create a new one. This way you'll have access to your notebook after the class. 
    * Otherwise, feel free to use the AAWG account that is up on the slide. But you'll need to download the notebook and run it separately after the class.
