### Files: 

* `AAWG.ipynb` = Beginner level intro to python for data science. 

* `AAWG_NLP.ipynb` = Advanced intro to Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling in python. 

### Workshop Instructions: 

* Clone or download this repo: 
  * Use the green "Clone or download" button on the right. 
  * If you already know how to use Git, you can clone it. 
  Otherwise, download it to your computer and unzip it. 
  * Get into the folder so you can see the two `.ipynb` files. 

* Start a Colab Jupyter session: 
  * go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and log in 
    * Either use your own personal gmail account (ideal) or create a new one. This way you'll have access to your notebook after the class. 
    * Otherwise, feel free to use the AAWG account that is up on the slide. But you'll need to download the notebook to keep your work and continue with it after the class. 

* Open the appropriate notebok in Colab: 
  * File > Open Notebook > Upload 
  * Either drag the file or navigate to it. 
  * You can also enter the link in GitHub, but you won't be able to save your work the same way. 

* When we're done, either keep it in your own gmail account, or download it to work on it elsewhere: 
  * File > Download .ipynb
